# RBF-Neural-Network-Handwritten-Digits
Radial Basis Function (RBF) Neural Network that can classify handwritten digits 0-9.

Training Data used from MNIST Database
60,000 data input used for training.

Network has 784 input layer neurons, 300 hidden layer neurons and 10 output layer neurons each for a digit 0-9.

RBF functions is used where the centers are selected based on random sampling of 300 data samples.

Perceptron rule is used to update weights (Upgrade to stochastic gradient descent rule in future maybe)
